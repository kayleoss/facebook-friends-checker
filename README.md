# facebook-friends-checker
This python script logs into a facebook account, gets all the friends' names and appends it into a new excel sheet as a column....

Ideally written for people who have less than 200 friends. Please adjust the scroll settings if you have more than 200 by increasing the range.

This script is mainly useful for those who would like to track who has unfriended them. By periodically running this script and saving your friends to an excel sheet you can use built in excel functions like sort & filter to figure out who has unfriended you. 


Libraries used: 
selenium, openpyxl
